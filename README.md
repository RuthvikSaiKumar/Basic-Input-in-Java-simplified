# Basic-Input-in-Java-simplified
Ever felt frustrated to create an object and input a string and then convert to the required type or experienced any issues while input. If so, this repo is just for you.

# Using
Using this is fairly simple. You don't even have to create the object of the class. Use the static functions for the inputs by :
```java
int a = Input.inputInt();
char c = Input.inputChar();
double d = Input.inputDouble();
...
```

# Download
You can download this jar file from the source or from the releases
